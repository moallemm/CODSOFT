this repository contains all the tasks that i did in my virutal internship(project based certifacte program) at codsoft

Task 1: I built a classification model to predict whether a passenger would survive the Titanic disaster. The goal was to classify passengers into one of two groups—survived or did not survive—based on features such as age, gender, class, and more.

As part of my analysis, I trained two models: KNN and Logistic Regression. The KNN model achieved an accuracy rate of 63.1%, while the Logistic Regression model performed better, with an accuracy rate of 78.2%.

Task 2: I worked on predicting movie ratings. The goal was to estimate the rating a movie might receive based on factors such as the movie’s genre, lead actors, release year, duration, director, and the number of votes.

I applied two models for this task: Linear Regression and KNN Regressor. The Linear Regression model achieved an R² score of 58.7%, while the KNN Regressor performed better, with an R² score of 66.9%.

Task 3: the Iris classification problem, a classic and well-known dataset in machine learning used to classify iris species based on features like petal and sepal dimensions. I implemented two models—KNN Classifier and Logistic Regression—achieving an accuracy of 93.3%. 

Task 4: I analyzed the Advertising dataset from Introduction to Statistical Learning (ISLR). This project explored the relationship between TV advertising and sales to understand how different advertising channels contribute to sales.

I built a Linear Regression model to predict sales based on advertising type—TV, Radio, or Newspaper—which achieved an accuracy rate of 90.5%.

Task 5:  I aimed to distinguish between fraudulent and legitimate transactions, a crucial endeavor in safeguarding financial systems.

The results were remarkable: the model achieved a 99.95% accuracy rate, showcasing its robustness in detecting fraud. The performance metrics further highlighted the model's strengths: a recall of 73%, indicating its effectiveness in identifying actual fraud cases, a precision of 95.57%, which reflects its accuracy in labeling transactions as fraud, and an F1 score of 83.3%, illustrating a solid balance between recall and precision.
